# Create variable called "variablenew" holding 100 values from 100 to 200.
# variablenew <-c(100:200)

# Calculate mean on variablenew for points 150 to 200
# mean(subset(variablenew, variablenew >= 150 & variablenew <= 200))
# [1] 175

# Calculate median on variablenew
# median(variablenew)
#[1] 150

# Calculate mean on variablenew for points 100 to 150
# mean(subset(variablenew, variablenew >= 100 & variablenew <= 150))
# [1] 125
